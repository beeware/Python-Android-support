# You can add patterns to this file to remove them
# from the Python-Android-support.zip file. Note that
# if you are removing files from the Python standard library,
# you need to use the 3.7.pythonhome-excludes file.
#
# Examples:
#
# libs/*/libssl*
# libs/*/libcrypto*
#
# These lines would remove OpenSSL. The libs/ directory contains
# JNI libraries for the Android app. The first asterisk is needed
# to match the pattern in all Android ABIs. The second asterisk
# is present for convenience, to avoid having to specify the full
# OpenSSL library name.
#
# libs/*/*xz*
#
# This line would remove the "xz" compression library. This might
# be appropriate if you don't use that compression format in your
# code.
